# Bellybutton Biodiversity Dashboard

Welcome to the Bellybutton Biodiversity Dashboard! This interactive web application allows you to explore the biodiversity data collected from different test subjects' belly buttons. You can visualize various aspects of the data through the provided interactive charts.

## How to Use

1. Open the web application by launching the HTML file in a web browser.

2. In the dropdown menu labeled "Test Subject ID No.:", select a test subject's ID from the list.

## Charts Included

### 1. Bar Chart

The bar chart displays the top 10 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) present in the selected test subject's belly button. Each bar represents the sample value of a specific OTU, and you can hover over the bars to see more details.

### 2. Gauge Chart

The gauge chart visualizes the weekly washing frequency of the test subject. The value on the gauge indicates how frequently the test subject washes their belly button.

### 3. Bubble Chart

The bubble chart presents a comprehensive view of the sample values and OTU IDs for the selected test subject. The size and color of the bubbles correspond to the sample values and OTU IDs, respectively.

## Technologies Used

- D3.js: A JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data.
- Plotly: An open-source JavaScript graphing library for interactive, publication-quality charts.
